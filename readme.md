# score-keep-meteor-react

This is a simple score keeping app using Meteor, MongoDB, and React. It was a tutorial app for Andrew Mead's course, [Full Stack Web Apps With React
and Meteor](https://www.udemy.com/share/1001kiAkoZcFlbRHg=/). I am currently in the process of updating it to 2019 standards React (16.8.x) and React-Router (4.x). 

### Installation Instructions 

Running the application requires Meteor to be installed. To install Meteor, go [here](https://www.meteor.com).

Install node_modules for the project:

`meteor npm install`

Launch the application:

`meteor`

### Instructions for Use

Use the **+** or **-** buttons to increment or decrement the user's score, or **x** to delete a player.
